			<h3><a href="/vari/Investment-Mandates.pdf"><b>Contracting to Compete for Flows </b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;">accepted at the <i> Journal of Economic Theory</i></span></h3>
				
				<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

				<p>Delegated asset managers frequently refer to credit ratings in the contracts they offer their investors. However, regulators have advised against this. Why? Contracting on ratings is a way for asset managers to compete for flows of investor capital.</a></p>	

			<h3><a href="/vari/VentureCapital.pdf"><b>Venture Capital and Capital Allocation</b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> forthcoming at the <i> Journal of Finance</i></span></h3>

				<p>In this paper, I show that venture capitalists’ career concerns can have beneficial effects in the primary market: they can mitigate information frictions, helping firms go public.</a></p>		


			<h3><a href="/vari/WarehouseBanking.pdf"><b>Warehouse Banking</b></a> <span style="font-weight:normal;">accepted at the <i>Journal of Financial Economics</i></span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>	

			<p>We develop a theory of banking that explains why banks started out as commodities warehouses. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions.</a></p>		



			<h3><a href="/vari/Wall-Street-Walk.pdf"><b>The Wall Street Walk when Blockholders Compete for Flows</b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"><i> Journal of Finance</i> 70 (6), 2015</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/dasgupt2/">Amil Dasgupta</a></p>

				<p>Many blockholders are money managers. We show that, when money managers compete for investor capital, the threat of a block sale (&quot;exit&quot;) loses credibility, weakening its governance role.</a></p>	

			
			<h2>Working Papers</h2>


			

			<h3><a href="/vari/LaborMarket.pdf"><b>Household Debt and Unemployment </b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;">(R&amp;R JF)</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>

				<p>Using a competitive search model, we find that levered households protected by limited liability engage in risk-shifting by searching for jobs with high wages but low employment probabilities.  The equilibrium level of household debt is inefficiently high due to a household-debt externality.</a></p>		


			

			<h3><a href="/vari/Deadlock.pdf"><b>Deadlock on the Board</b></a></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="https://www2.bc.edu/nadya-malenko/">Nadya Malenko</a></p>

			<p>In a dynamic model of board decision making, directors strategically block proposals that benefit other directors. Such deadlock on the board explains CEO entrenchment and strategic inertia. We study how board composition affects deadlock, and find, for example, that board diversity can exacerbate it. </a></p>		


			<h3><a href="/vari/Netting.pdf"><b>Netting</b></a></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

						<p>Banks hold gross debts without netting them out.  Why?  These gross debts implement valuable contingent transfers via the option to dilute.</a></p>	


			<h3><a href="/vari/Money-Runs.pdf"><b>Money Runs</b></a></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

						<p>We present a banking model in which bank debt is traded over the counter like banknotes were in the nineteenth century and repos are today. This focus on bank money creation reveals a new rationale for demandable debt and a new type of bank run, or &quot;money run.&quot;</a></p>	


			<h3><a href="/vari/Paradox-of-pledgeability.pdf"><b>The Paradox of Pledgeability</b></a></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://www.denisgromb.com/">Denis Gromb</a></p>


				<p>We develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of competing creditors. We find that collateralized borrowing has a cost: it encumbers assets, constraining future borrowing and investment---there is a collateral overhang.</a></p>	



			<h3><a href="/vari/Capital-Allocation.pdf"><b>Do Institutional Investors Improve Capital Allocation?</b></a></h3>
			<p>(Largely subsumed by Venture Capital and Capital Allocation)</p>

			<h3><a href="/vari/Credit-Market-Competition.pdf"><b>Intermediation Variety</b></a></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>

				<p>Non-depository financial intermediaries (&quot;non-banks&quot;) have a higher cost of capital than depositories (&quot;banks&quot;) do, because they do not benefit from government safety nets. How do they still compete with banks?  Non-banks use their high cost of capital as a commitment device not to fund traditional projects, inducing entrepreneurs to innovative efficiently.</a></p>
