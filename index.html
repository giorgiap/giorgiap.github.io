			<h3><a href="/vari/Paradox-of-pledgeability.pdf"><b>The Paradox of Pledgeability
</b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> accepted at the <i> Journal of Financial Economics</i></span></h3>

			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://www.denisgromb.com/">Denis Gromb</a></p>


				<p>We develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of competing creditors. We find that collateralized borrowing has a cost: it encumbers assets, constraining future borrowing and investment---there is a collateral overhang.</a></p>


			<h3><a href="/vari/LaborMarket.pdf"><b>Household Debt and Unemployment </b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2019, <i> Journal of Finance</i> 74 (4)</span></h3>

			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>

				<p>Using a search model, we find that levered households protected by limited liability suffer from a household-debt-overhang problem that leads them to require high wages to work.  Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies.   The equilibrium level of household debt is inefficiently high due to a household-debt externality.</a></p>		
 
			

			<h3><a href="/vari/VentureCapital.pdf"><b>Venture Capital and Capital Allocation</b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2019, <i> Journal of Finance</i> 74 (4)</span></h3>

				<p>I show that venture capitalists’ career concerns can have beneficial effects in the primary market: they can mitigate information frictions, helping firms go public.</a></p>		


			<h3><a href="/vari/WarehouseBanking.pdf"><b>Warehouse Banking</b></a> <span style="font-weight:normal;">2018,<i> Journal of Financial Economics</i> 129 (2)</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>	

			<p>We develop a theory of banking that explains why banks started out as commodities warehouses. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions.</a></p>		

			<h3><a href="/vari/Investment-Mandates.pdf"><b>Contracting to Compete for Flows</b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2018,<i> Journal of Economic Theory</i> 173</span></h3>
				
				<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

				<p>Delegated asset managers frequently refer to public information, such as credit ratings and benchmark indices, in the contracts they offer their investors. However, regulators have advised against this. Why do asset managers refer to public inforamtion in their contracts? We show that it is a way for asset managers to compete for flows of investor capital, even though it is socially inefficient. </a></p>	


			<h3><a href="/vari/Wall-Street-Walk.pdf"><b>The Wall Street Walk when Blockholders Compete for Flows</b></a> </a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2015, <i> Journal of Finance</i> 70 (6)</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/dasgupt2/">Amil Dasgupta</a></p>

				<p>Many blockholders are money managers. We show that, when money managers compete for investor capital, the threat of a block sale (&quot;exit&quot;) loses credibility, weakening its governance role.</a></p>	



			
			<h2>Working Papers</h2>

				<h3><a href="/vari/Deadlock.pdf"><b>Deadlock on the Board</b></a></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2018 (Revise and resubmit at the <i> Review of Financial Studies</i>)</h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="https://www2.bc.edu/nadya-malenko/">Nadya Malenko</a></p>

			<p><b>ASU Sonoran Winter Finance Conference 2018 Best Paper Award</b></a></p>	

			<p>In a dynamic model of board decision making, directors strategically block proposals that benefit other directors. Such deadlock on the board explains CEO entrenchment and strategic inertia. We study how board composition affects deadlock, and find, for example, that board diversity can exacerbate it. 	


			
			<h3><a href="/vari/Credit-Market-Competition.pdf"><b>Intermediation Variety</b> </a></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2017 (Revise and resubmit at the <i> Journal of Finance</i>)</h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thakor/">Anjan Thakor</a></p>

				<p>Non-depository financial intermediaries (&quot;non-banks&quot;) have a higher cost of capital than depositories (&quot;banks&quot;) do, because they do not benefit from government safety nets. How do they still compete with banks?  Non-banks use their high cost of capital as a commitment device not to fund traditional projects, inducing entrepreneurs to innovative efficiently.</a></p>

	<h3><a href="/vari/Money-Runs.pdf"><b>Money Runs</b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2019</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

						<p>We present a banking model in which bank debt is traded over the counter like banknotes were in the nineteenth century and repos are today. This focus on bank money creation reveals a new rationale for demandable debt and a new type of bank run, or &quot;money run.&quot;</a></p>	


			
	<h3><a href="/vari/OpportunityCost.pdf"><b>The Opportunity Cost of Collateral</b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2018</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/minalee/home">Jeongmin (Mina) Lee</a></p>

			<p>Interbank debt is money-like, but not a perfect substitute for cash: it can be hard to convert to cash to fund new investments. Hence, interbank lending comes with an opportunity cost that generates positive spreads even absent any credit risk. These spreads enter banks’ collateral constraints, generating a feedback between the opportunity cost in the credit market and the price of collateral in the asset market. This results in instability in the form of multiple equilibria, casting light on repo runs. We provide a new rational for counter-cyclical capital regulation.</a></p>

		
		<h3><a href="/vari/ConflictingPriorities.pdf"><b>Conflicting Priorities: A Theory of Covenants and Collateral</b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2018</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a> and <a href="http://www.denisgromb.com/">Denis Gromb</a></p>
		
		<p>We develop a model in which the absolute priority of secured debt leads to conflicts among creditors, but can be optimal nonetheless. The option to use collateral to dilute unsecured debt, even in violation of covenants, loosens financial constraints that could be inefficiently tight.  But covenants embed an acceleration option that prevents these constraints from becoming inefficiently loose.</a></p>

			
		

		


			<h3><a href="/vari/Netting.pdf"><b>Netting</b></a><span style="font-weight:normal;"> 2018</span></h3>
			<p>With <a href="http://jrdonaldson.com/">Jason R Donaldson</a></p>

						<p>Banks hold gross debts without netting them out.  Why?  These gross debts implement valuable contingent transfers via the option to dilute.</a></p>
