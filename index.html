        <strong> with Amil Dasgupta</strong> <br>
        
        An important recent theoretical literature argues that the threat of exit can be an effective form of governance when the blockholder is a principal. However, a significant fraction of blockholders are delegated portfolio managers. How do agency frictions arising from such delegation affect the ability of blockholders to govern via the threat of exit? Fund managers are often subject to short-term flow-performance relationships and differ in the degree to which they care about investor flows. We show that when blockholders are sufficiently concerned about investor flows, exit will fail as a disciplining device. Our result generates testable implications across different classes of funds: only those funds who have relatively high powered incentives will be effective in using exit as a governance mechanism. We also show that the threat of exit can complement shareholder voice, and thus provide a potential explanation for the empirically observed variation across different types of portfolio managers’ use of voice.</p> 

        <p><FONT SIZE=+1><a href="vari/Donaldson-Piacentino.pdf">Overrating Agencies: Competition, Collusion, and Regulation</a></FONT> <br> 
         <strong>with Jason R Donaldson</strong>   <br>

              We model the rating agencies’ assessment of corporate securities issues with competitive, profit-maximizing agencies certifying issuers whose project choice depends on the value they can fetch for their issue in the market, namely on their anticipated rating. We begin our analysis with a static monopolistic setting and progressively expand it to end up studying repeated issues and endogenously colluding agencies. In the static environment where there is only one issue a monopolistic agency always overrates to maximize its profits. Since good firms anticipate that the credit rating agencies will make them unable to distinguish themselves by pooling them with bad ones, they pass over positive NPV investment opportunities. Competition ameliorates the situation: Rating agencies are not only honest but cheap, setting prices equal to marginal costs à la Bertrand competition. Firms undertake all good investment opportunities. However, when rating agencies interact repeatedly they are liable to collude. Our main result rests on the number of good investment opportunities in the market. When they are plentiful, like at the beginning of an economic upturn, rating agencies are honest and good firms innovate. Credit rating agencies set their fees so high, however, that some firms with positive NPV projects stay out of the market to avoid the cost of being rated. At the height of the boom, however, after new investments have dried up, ratings agencies start to overrate and firms thus stop investing. We show the amplifying effect rating agencies had in the last crisis: First investment opportunities waned in accordance with the business cycle, and then ratings agencies’ practices changed resulting in a further choking off of investment and fomenting economic collapse.</p>


          <p><FONT SIZE=+1>Investment Mandates and the Downside of Precise Credit Ratings</a></FONT> <br> 
         <strong>with Jason R Donaldson</strong>   <br>

        We take an optimal contracting approach to the delegated portfolio management problem with a particular focus on funds’ investment mandates and references to credit ratings. Our paper fills a void in the literature on investment mandates in that the misalignment of incentives between the fund and investor comes only from the excessive risk tolerance of the asset manager, so that the role of the contract is simultaneously to share risk and to curb the fund's risk-shifting. But our paper is as much about ratings as investment mandates. We aim to understand the potential for credit rating agencies to improve efficiencies and create distortions even when they do not provide fund managers with new information, but rather just augment his contracting space with investors. The main result is that less precise ratings lead to Pareto improvements in the economy. Three forces are at work: one, investment mandates written on portfolio weights alone are affective in implementing the efficient investment; two, investment mandates written on credit ratings prevent investors and fund managers from sharing risk over the outcome of the rating itself; and, three, competition among fund managers forces them to contract upon credit ratings thereby shutting down the possibility for risk sharing.</p>
